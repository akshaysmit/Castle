Important things to note:

1. There is a small delay at the beginning of the animation to allow the scene to fully load
2. The scene begins with the animation and during this time the camera cannot be manually moved
3. After the animation is finished, the camera can be moved using the skeleton code controls
4. In order to DISABLE THE ANIMATION, comment out line 170 in main-scene.js, this line is in the
   display function
5. Our advanced feature was NORMAL MAPPING. Our grey brick texture that dominates the buildings is
   normally mapped. The effect is very obvious when looking at the front of the scene, where the
   light is falling on the buildings. The realistic bumpiness is pretty cool
6. We also used normal mapping for some red brick textures on cylinders and a UCLA Bruins logo
   on some of the cylinders located at the top of our scene
7. We have many, many, many parametric surfaces. We have a TORUS at the front of the scene, two grey
   MOBIUS STRIPS on the sides, and our domes are Bezier curves with 4 control points, rotated around an axis
   In our code, there is a function to draw a Bezier curve with 4 control points and rotate it, called
   Bezier4_rot. The Mobius Strip is actually a bilinear patch.
8. We have satisfied all requirements, including the advanced feature (normal mapping). We modified the
   shaders to implement normal mapping.
